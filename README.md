# AdvancedHMI
AdvancedHMI is a comprehensive set of components for Visual Studio that can facilitate the generation of human-machine interfaces (HMIs) with ease.

The library can make HMI building simple and fast since it allows you to drag and drop elements into the workspace. It replaces the need for generating advanced scripts and simplifies the code-writing process.

AdvancedHMI features support for various drivers and allows you to create user-friendly interfaces for PLCs (programmable logic controller).

In other words, build platforms that display the information sent and received to/from a PLC. This feature makes the library a suitable solution for creating interfaces for large automation devices, such as machines used in serial production in various industries.

It can be a real help for assembly lines, amusement rides or light fixtures engineers. The tool offers full support for Allen Bradley DF1 RS232 drivers, Ethernet/IP driver for SLC and MicroLogix, ModbusTCP, ModbusRTU, Omron or TwinCAT drivers.

The drivers are available to you via Visual Basic or C# code. Moreover, the tool can work with VB.NET and several other .NET class libraries or languages, to offer you the possibility to create simple HMIs or powerful SCADA interfaces.

Moreover, the library allows you to generate reliable and visually appealing interfaces even for complex machinery.

You can build advanced controllers and monitoring tools that facilitate your interaction with the PLC, in a quick and effortless manner.

AdvancedHMI comes with several examples and sample code files that allow you to test the interaction with Allen Bradley, Modbus, Omron or TwinCAT drivers.

Additionally, these templates can be used as snippets or examples for generating your script. The library package also features comprehensive documentation, a step-by-step introduction to working with this component in Visual Studio.
